# System Patterns

## Architecture Overview
> _Initial Placeholder_  
Describe the high-level architecture, including client, server, database, and integration layers. Use diagrams (Mermaid) where helpful.

## Key Design Patterns
| Pattern | Usage | Reason |
|---------|-------|--------|
| MVC / MVVM | Front-end state and UI separation | Maintainable UI logic |
| Repository | Data access layer | Decouples persistence from business logic |
| Dependency Injection | Service wiring | Improves testability |

## Component Relationships
> _Initial Placeholder_  
Explain how major components (e.g., API Gateway, Auth Service, Recipe Service, Front-end client) interact.

## Critical Implementation Paths
1. **Recipe CRUD Flow** – UI → API → Service → DB  
2. **Search Flow** – UI → Search Service → Caching Layer → DB  
3. **Auth Flow** – UI → Auth Service → Token Validation

> Flesh out details as they are implemented.
