# Progress

_Last updated: 2025-06-18_

## What Works
- Memory Bank directory initialized with all core context files.
- Initial project brief, product context, system patterns, tech context, and active context documented.
- Python virtual environment (`.venv`) created and Flask + Flask-CORS installed for the backend.

## What's Left to Build
- Detailed architecture diagrams in `systemPatterns.md`.
- Feature roadmap and sprint schedule documents.
- Backend API scaffolding and database schema.
- Front-end project setup with React and Tailwind CSS.
- CI/CD pipeline with GitHub Actions.
- Comprehensive unit and integration tests.

## Current Status
Phase: **Planning / Documentation**  
Confidence: **High** â€“ foundation laid for upcoming development tasks.

## Known Issues
- Architecture details still placeholders.
- No project codebase scaffolding yet.
- Frontend failing to load React Router DOM UMD bundle (blocks rendering).
- Metrics instrumentation not defined.

## Evolution of Decisions
- Chose PostgreSQL over MongoDB for relational recipe data.
- Opted for monorepo to share logic between web and mobile apps.
- Selected Tailwind CSS to speed up consistent styling.
