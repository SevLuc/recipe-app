# Product Context

## Why This Project Exists
Consumers struggle to organize, discover, and share cooking ideas efficiently. Existing recipe platforms are often cluttered, lacking advanced filtering, and have inconsistent user experiences across devices. Our Recipe App aims to centralize high-quality recipes, streamline discovery, and enable effortless sharing.

## Problems It Solves
1. Fragmented recipe storage across multiple apps or bookmarks.
2. Ineffective search and filtering (e.g., by dietary preference, available ingredients).
3. Limited mobile-first experiences for cooking in the kitchen.
4. Difficulty sharing clearly formatted recipes with friends and family.

## How It Should Work
- Seamless onboarding with social sign-in and guided recipe import.
- Powerful search bar with ingredient-based suggestions and saved searches.
- Step-by-step cooking mode featuring hands-free navigation (voice or tap).
- Collaborative recipe editing for family members or friends.
- Offline access for previously viewed recipes on mobile.

## User Experience Goals
- “3-tap Rule”: Users can find a relevant recipe in ≤ 3 taps/clicks.
- Consistent experience across web, iOS, and Android.
- High readability with large fonts and dark-mode support while cooking.
- Accessible interactions for users with motor impairments.

## Primary Personas
1. **Busy Home Cook** – Needs quick weekday meals, advanced filtering by prep time and ingredients on hand.
2. **Food Enthusiast** – Wants to discover and curate unique recipes, focuses on high-quality images and reviews.
3. **Health-Conscious User** – Filters recipes by nutritional information and dietary restrictions.

## Success Metrics
- Daily Active Users (DAU) ≥ 5k within six months of launch.
- Average search-to-cook conversion rate ≥ 40%.
- Recipe share events per week ≥ 1,000.
